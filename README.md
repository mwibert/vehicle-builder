This is a text-based vehicle simulator. You can create a new vehicle with your own specificications or use one of the existing within the program. 
You may choose from a car, a truck, or a motorbike, each of which you can create, or choose an existing one. 
The vehicles can be driven through text based actions which you are prompted to select on-screen. 
Some of the vehicles have unique actions they can perform, for example the truck can tow if it's capacity allows, and the motorbike can wheelie!
This program was written using typescript JS with the assistance of my Instructor and a tutor. ChatGPT was also used to aid in debugging.
Code can be found in the .src/classes directory
